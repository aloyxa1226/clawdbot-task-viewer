# Validation Report: ClawdBot Task Viewer v1.1

**Date:** 2026-01-28  
**PRD:** docs/PRD.md  
**Validator:** AI Agent

---

## Problem Resolution

**Original Problem:** When ClawdBot breaks down complex work into tasks, visibility is limited to the terminal session. Users need a persistent, visual dashboard.

**Evidence of Solution:**
- ✅ Kanban board displays tasks visually across 5 status columns
- ✅ Tasks persist in PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Real-time polling every 5 seconds
- ✅ Session filter allows viewing specific sessions or all

**Status:** ✅ PASS
